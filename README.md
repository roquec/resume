Roque Carrizo's resume single source of truth.

* Resume [`roquec.github.io/resume/`](https://roquec.github.io/resume/)
* PDF [`roque-carrizo-resume.pdf`](https://roquec.github.io/resume/roque-carrizo-resume.pdf)


## Build

The source file for the resume lives in:
```
/src/resume.md
```

From the source file two output files are generated by [ci-cd workflow](https://github.com/roquec/resume/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml) on push:
```
/output/resume.html
```
```
/output/resume.pdf
```

The output files are automatically committed into the repo.


## Deploy

Both output files are published to GitHub Pages [here](https://roquec.github.io/resume/) as:
```
/index.html
/roque-carrizo-resume.pdf
```
